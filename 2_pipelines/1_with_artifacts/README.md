# 🏆 pipeline with artifacts

Artifacts are outputs generated by pipeline components.

# Things learned
- [x] Artifacts
- [x] Vertex ML Metadata
- [x] Vertex AI Datasets

# Overview
Here we'll define a 3-step pipeline with the following custom components:
- `get_dataframe`: Download data from BigQuery and convert to CSV
- `train_sklearn_model`: Train a Scikit-learn model and export it along with a `Metrics` artifact 🏆 that includes our model's accuracy, framework, and size of the dataset used to train it
- `deploy_model`: Deploy the exported model to an endpoint in Vertex AI

In this pipeline we use the UCI Machine Learning [Dry beans dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset). It's a tabular dataset. We will classify beans into one of 7 types based on their characteristics.
