# Artifacts 🏆
Artifacts are outputs generated by pipeline steps.  
There are many types of artifacts. In this particular pipeline we have dataset, metrics, model, and endpoint artifacts.  
Every artifact has Lineage, which describes the other artifacts it's connected to (click on artifact, then on the View Lineage button).

# Overview
In this pipeline we use the UCI Machine Learning [Dry beans dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset). It's a tabular dataset. We will classify beans into one of 7 types based on their characteristics.

We define a 3-step pipeline with the following custom components:
- `get_data`: Download data from BigQuery and convert to CSV
- `train_model`: Train a Scikit-learn model and export it along with a `Metrics` artifact 🏆 that includes our model's accuracy, framework, and size of the dataset used to train it
- `deploy_model`: Deploy the exported model to an endpoint in Vertex AI. It returns the URIs to both the model and endpoint resources as artifacts 🏆
