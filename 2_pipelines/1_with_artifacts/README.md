# 🏆 pipeline with artifacts

Artifacts are outputs generated by pipeline components.

# Things learned
- [x] Artifacts
- [x] Vertex ML Metadata
- [x] Vertex AI Datasets

# Overview
Here we'll define a 3-step pipeline with the following custom components:
- `get_dataframe`: Retrieve data from a BigQuery table and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame
- `train_sklearn_model`: Use the Pandas DataFrame to train and export a Scikit Learn model, along with some metrics
- `deploy_model`: Deploy the exported Scikit Learn model to an endpoint in Vertex AI

In this pipeline we use the UCI Machine Learning [Dry beans dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset). It's a tabular dataset. We will classify beans into one of 7 types based on their characteristics.
