# Vertex AI Pipelines
Compared to other cloud providers, Google has made a decision not to develop product-specific pipelines (such as AWS Sagemaker) but to instead rely on the open source technologies. So two formats are supported:
- Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
- Tensor Flow Extended (TFX)

# This notebook
This notebook is an introduction to using Vertex AI Pipelines with the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK.  
We define and compile a Vertex AI Pipeline.  
Our pipeline has 3 steps, where each step is defined as a component.
